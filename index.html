					<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
					   Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
					   Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                       And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
					   Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 5<br>
					   And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
					   And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
					   By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;<br>
					   But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br>
					   Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; 10<br>
					   Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br>
					   When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br>
					   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
					   So long lives this and this gives life to thee.<br>

					<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth<br>
					   I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>
					   That she might think me some untutor’d youth,<br>
					   Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.<br>
					   Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>
					   Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>
					   Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:<br>
					   On both sides thus is simple truth suppress’d.<br>
					   But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>
					   And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
					   O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,<br>
					   And age in love loves not to have years told:<br>
					   Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<br>
					   And in our faults by lies we flatter’d be.<br>

					<p>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,<br>
					   I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
					   And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
					   And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br>
					   Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
					   Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,<br>
					   Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,<br>
					   With what I most enjoy contented least;<br>
					   Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,<br>
					   Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br>
					   Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
					   From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;<br>
					   For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings<br>
					   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<br>

					<p>When in the chronicle of wasted time<br>
					   I see descriptions of the fairest wights,<br>
					   And beauty making beautiful old rhyme<br>
					   In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,<br>
					   Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,<br>
					   Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,<br>
					   I see their antique pen would have express’d<br>
					   Even such a beauty as you master now.<br>
					   So all their praises are but prophecies<br>
					   Of this our time, all you prefiguring;<br>
					   And, for they look’d but with divining eyes,<br>
					   They had not skill enough your worth to sing:<br>
					   For we, which now behold these present days,<br>
					   Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.<br>
